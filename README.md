a setup/build file for a site for managing access to media files

This only works in Unix/Linix

It's simple. 
run "python makeVidServer" in command prompt.
Then follow prompts provided in program. 

the path for the media file you want to add
must be a directory, no quotation marks 
required ex.: C:\User\FolderWithMediaFiles

The program will parse through every folder and
file under that directory.

If there are multiple directories, enter them
as the prompt requests.

Pick a color for your site, don't put the quotation marks.

Give your site a name as prompted.

Then provide the directory where you want the site to be stored.
ex.: C\User\SiteFolder 

The site folder should not exists before hand. The program will
build it.
